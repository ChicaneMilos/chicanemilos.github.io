                <p><strong>QuizGame</strong> is a codename for a Unity-based quiz game, currently in development,
                    designed to provide an engaging and educational experience. This game is actively <strong>used
                        by</strong> the <strong>Academy of Applied Technical and Preschool Studies</strong>, a
                    <strong>college</strong> in Niš, Serbia, during <strong>promotional events</strong> to showcase the
                    institution in an interactive manner using <strong>VR technology</strong> and testing participants'
                    knowledge through quizzes.</p>

                <h2 id="features">Features</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Quiz Creation and Management:</strong> Allows the creation and management of the
                        quizzes. Players can easily add, edit, or delete quizzes, as well as individual questions and
                        answers. Each question can have up to 4 possible answers, with one designated as the correct
                        answer. This flexibility allows for continuous updates and customization of quiz content.</li>
                    <li><strong>Immersive Gameplay:</strong> Players navigate through a 3D maze where questions are
                        displayed on the screen. Each question is presented with four possible answers in the A, B, C, D
                        format. Players must select the correct door that corresponds to the right answer to progress
                        through the maze. This structure adds an interactive and challenging experience, while the
                        LED-inspired visuals enhance the sense of exploration and mystery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Score Summary:</strong> At the end of the quiz, players are presented with feedback
                        based on their performance. The game calculates and displays the player's score as a percentage
                        of correct answers, providing immediate feedback on their success.</li>
                    <li><strong>Easy Import and Export:</strong> Quizzes can be easily imported and exported in JSON
                        format, simplifying the process of sharing and managing quiz data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Time Limit:</strong> Players can set customizable time limits for completing quizzes.
                        This feature adds an extra layer of challenge by requiring players to answer all questions
                        within the specified time frame, with a visual countdown to track remaining time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ad Banners:</strong> Customizable ad banners allow players to add dynamic images on the
                        quiz walls. These banners can be used to enhance the game environment by including educational
                        content, branding, or even promotional materials.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="future-development">Future Development</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>VR Compatibility:</strong> The game will be fully playable in both VR and non-VR modes,
                        enhancing the immersive experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rewards System:</strong> In future updates, rewards will be tied to the percentage
                        score. Players who achieve higher percentages will receive better rewards. For VR users, these
                        rewards will include virtual travel experiences, while non-VR users will have alternative
                        rewards designed to enhance their gameplay experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Project Status:</strong> The project has reached an advanced stage of development, with
                        all core functionalities fully implemented. The remaining feature to be implemented is VR
                        support, which will further enhance the user experience for virtual reality users. Stay tuned
                        for updates!</li>
